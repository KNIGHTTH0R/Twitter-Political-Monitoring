# Twitter-Political-Monitoring

How easily can social media data be used to politically “monitor” U.S. persons? Through the creation of a program that aggregates tweets based off of specific hashtags or keywords that criticize the government, I aim to prove that the U.S. government can politically monitor activists by gathering data that identifies their locations. The implications of such a program are large: this data can be used as a means to suppress dissenters of the current political power.
